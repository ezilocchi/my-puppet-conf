My Puppet Conf
==============

This is just an example project showing how to get a Ruby on Rails environment up and running with just one command line. It was original created for (but it can be easily modified to run with other setups):

- Ubuntu 13.10 (since it’s one of the most supported distros in the linux community)
- Rbenv as Ruby manager (there is no way of developing ruby without a Ruby Version Manager. You can user RVM as well)
- Postgresql (since it’s 100% open source and it’s the heroku default)
- VIM (with janus distribution)
- Nodejs (since it’s the most popular and stable JS engine)
- Git (it doesn't need any explanation)

Any contribution to improve (like proposing a better way of writing the config) or add more features (like supporting others linux distributions) is very welcomed :).
